# Dementia-Detection
What are we trying to solve:
Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. Dementia is not a specific disease. Its an overall term that describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a persons ability to perform everyday activities. In this use case, we propose to develop a sound model that can help clinicians detect dementia for proactive identification. Considering that we have to predict whether a patient might have dementia or not, this is a binary classification problem.

Machine Learning Algorithm:
Powerful Random forest model is used to model the solution for this analysis.

* Random Forest Classifier is an implementation designed for speed and performance.
* Random Forest Classifier dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and predictive modeling problems.
